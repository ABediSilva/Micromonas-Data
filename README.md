This repository data and scripts to compare the growth rates of Micromonas isolates that are either susceptible or resistant to viral lytic infection. Cell isolates were grown under two separate treatments, high and low light. The first growth experiment took place in May 2018, finding significant depression in growth rates among resistant cell lines, particularly a high light. The second experiment took place in September 2019, only using a handful of cell lines analyzed in May 2018, and found that this depression in growth rate in resistant cell lines attenuated.

Within this repository, you will find individual folders for the May 2018 and September 2019 experiment. Each folder contains:
1. A csv file contain plate reader data and cell line metadata.
2. Two csv files containing the date of exponential growth for each cell line. One csv is for the high light treatment, the other for the low light treatment.
3. A R script with regression and generalized mixed models to assess differences in growth rates.


##May 2024 commits
Major commits were made in May 2024 to tidy up data files and R script.
